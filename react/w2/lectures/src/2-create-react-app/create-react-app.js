// What are the steps to creating a new react project?
// $ npx create-react-app project-name-using-kebab-case
// $ npx create-react-app@version-number project-name-using-kebab-case

// 1. In your terminal cd into the directory (i.e. folder) you want to place the project in (DO NOT make a new project folder inside of another project folder, doing this will make your computer instantly combust).
// 2. Once you have arrived in the directory (i.e. folder) you want to place the project folder run the following:

// npx create-react-app app-name-separated-by-hyghens
// npx create-react-app@specific-react-version app-name-separated-by-hyghens

// 3. Open your project in VS Code (there's several ways to do this). I prefer doing it in the terminal but you can do it however you feel most comfortable. In the same location you created the project run.

// code app-name
